Movie Genre Classification

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify movie descriptions into different genres. The model is built using Logistic Regression and the TF-IDF vectorizer to extract meaningful features from movie plot descriptions.

Approach:

The movie descriptions are processed and converted into a numerical format using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
A Logistic Regression model is trained on labeled movie genre data.
The model predicts the genre of a randomly selected movie description from the test dataset.
