Spam Email Detector

This project implements a spam email classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify emails as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The model is built using Logistic Regression and the TF-IDF vectorizer to process email messages and predict their categories.

Approach:

The email messages are preprocessed and converted into a numerical format using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

A Logistic Regression model is trained using labeled email data (spam and ham categories).

The trained model predicts whether an email is spam or not based on the content of the message.
