1. Movie Genre Classification

Description: A text classification model that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary. The model is trained using a logistic regression algorithm with the TF-IDF vectorizer.

Approach: The movie plot summaries are preprocessed and converted into numerical features using TF-IDF, and a logistic regression model is trained to classify the genre.

2. Spam Email Detection
Description: A spam email detector that classifies email messages as "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The model is trained using a logistic regression classifier and a TF-IDF vectorizer.

Approach: Email messages are preprocessed and transformed into TF-IDF features. A logistic regression model is trained to classify emails as either spam or ham.
